# Domain of Interest
Our domain is Education and Socioeconomic Factors.
We are interested in this domain because there are many disparities in education level between communities throughout the US and between countries, and we think it would be interesting to figure out what factors cause these disparities.

Examples of projects in the domain:

- [Exploring the relationship between socioeconomic status and participation and attainment in science education](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2008/4294969756.pdf)
- [Education and Socioeconomic Status Factsheet](https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education)
- [Language learning socioeconomic status, and child-directed speech](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901657/)

Data-driven questions:

- What socioeconomic factors most strongly influence educational attainment?
- How much do certain socioeconomic factors affect education?
- What aspects of educational achievement do socioeconomic factors affect?

# Finding Data
- [U.S. Education Datasets: Unification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project):
The data was obtained through a script made in Python by Roy Garrard. The data was sourced by the U.S. Census Bureau and National Center of Education Statistics. The data is a collection of all US education factors such as enrollment, financing, and educational achievement. There are 1715 unique rows of states with their respective year. There are also 25 columns of unique features in the data set. In the above questions, it will be able to answer the question about how socioeconomic factors affect education as well as academic achievement.
- [USA Unemployment & Education Level](https://www.kaggle.com/valbauman/student-engagement-online-learning-supplement):
This data is from Kaggle, from user Val Bauman, and the information in the datasets are sourced from the USDA Economic Research Service. The dataset shows the percentage of adults from various educational backgrounds and their employment status by county. There are 72.2k rows, each tagged with either county, suburb, town, and rural, and then the level and proportion of education detailed in each row. There are 48 columns for each entry, with various levels of education, and other statistics. With this dataset, we should be able to draw a correlation between levels of education and employment, as we make the assumption that education and employment are linked.
- [Educational Attainment](https://data.ca.gov/en/dataset/educational-attainment):
This data set is called Educational Attainment and it comes from a website called CA.gov - California Open Data Portal. The data was collected by the California Department of Public Health. The data is about students who continued their education after highschool and have already achieved or are aiming for a four year degree. The data takes percent of population for students and groups of people with an age of 25 and higher. The data examines the socioeconomic status and socioeconomic effects due to education. There are 166,662 rows of information holding data organized by columns. There are 26 columns in the data holding information by race, geographic unit, country, region, percent of population, and more. The data from this dataset can answer questions about the socioeconomic status and effects from continuing education and how many people continue education after high school for a 4-year degree or higher.
